First Advanced Modular structure Project

### Important points about the project:

a.) Run 'python application.py' and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict to check the API fot predicting Diamond price by giving the input parameters(data).

b.) All the main ML code is written inside 'src' folder.

c.) If we want to check if the ML flow is executed well, run the command 'python src/pipelines/training_pipeline.py'.

This will execute all the 3 major processes : Data Ingestion, Data Transforamtion and Model Training.
